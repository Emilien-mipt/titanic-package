# Titanic package
## Motivation
Many novice data scientists begin their journey in data science
by building models on the well-known [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
They tend to do that in jupyter notebooks, which is a nice tool for EDA and
building simple models. However, when it comes to pushing the built models to production
this tool becomes inconvenient.

In fact, there are some steps that should be done in order to prepare the model for
production such as organizing the code in modules, writing tests, adding linters
and type checks and e.t.c. However, I noticed that the majority of my students
are not aware of such steps.

Therefore, I created this repository to teach my students on how to switch from jupyter
notebooks to production code and wrap the models into python package, so that it could be used later
in different applications such as web application. As an example in this repo the model is built on the Titanic dataset,
therefore the built package is called "titanic_model".

This repo is heavily influenced by the excellent
course at Udemy
["Deployment of Machine Learning Models"](https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/).
